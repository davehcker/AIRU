# A GENTLE INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
VERY ESSENTIAL NOTES, REMARKS, LINKS, MUSINGS, ETC. FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.
Rendered [here](https://davehcker.github.io/airu/)

## WHAT IS THIS?
There is no dearth of learning resources for getting comfortable with the vast field of Machine Learning (or AI or Data Science or Statistics for Hacker). I found that to be the biggest hurdle- what to learn and what to leave. I keep this repo updated with 'notes' that I collect from various awesome sources in the fields.

Some of the sources for these notes are:

**[Fast.ai](fast.ai)**

**Andrew Ng's** Stanford course on **Machine Learning**.


Andrew Ng's **[deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai)**

**Books:**

Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell

Elements of Statistical Learning

**So how do I not overfit? Afterall, overfitting is not good.**

It's often very tempting to include all the interesting stuff that we find deep diving into the books (and the brains of geniuses), and unlike machines, we are tempted by the brain chemicals we've not yet understood well enough. But if I can't restrain myself, then this repo will end up becoming a scraped version of the above sources- too bad to type if anyone can just write a scraper.
The only way I have found helpful is to limit my goal here- **A complete but minimal survery of the field**. And by complete, I am limiting the definition to include the following topics, and only to a degree that we get the **Pareto return**, i.e. getting 80% for 20% effort.
